Update 1.0 - Added gifs to portfolio page thumbnails and added more projects too.

## My Personal Webpage

 We were tasked with utilizing a combination of bootstrap and css to design a responsive personal portfolio which can be viewed on any device size. I found this assignment to be very invigorating and helped me learn proper webpage structure and design. I look forward to adding my further education to this page.


### Home Page Key Components

- Utilized a bootstrap navbar for the top of my page.
- Added in icons for my social media that interact just like the links do witha hover pseudo attached to them.
- Used a bootstrap jumbotron with a background image defined in CSS. This image highlights a recent trip I took to the Appalachian Trail.
- Used bootstrap's grid system for my <main> section. This columns are all responsive and were checked on dev tools.
- Utilzed bootstraps block buttons for my "Quick Links" section. Also added :hover to each link. 
- My footer is a static footer that also has links to my social networks. 
- Added a personalized favicon.
